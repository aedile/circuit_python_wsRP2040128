# circuit_python_wsRP2040128
A Circuitpython implementation of the Waveshare RP2040-LCD-1.28.  I purchased this device and found the 
documentation and implementations for it in Circuitpython were lacking.  I wanted to use it for some 
rapid prototyping but don't have time to properly format and contribute back to the community.  I'm making this public as a compromise.
